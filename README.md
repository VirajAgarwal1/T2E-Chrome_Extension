<b>This project uses a bunch of technologies used in it which are listed over here:-</b> <br />

This chrome extension is specifically made for the website Indiamart sellers can connect with buyers. They do this in the form of leads that sellers can pursue or leave. Once the leads are bought they are shown in the Lead Manager tab with information on the buyer and his/her requirements. But there is a flaw in the website in which the seller has to click multiple times to go to different parts of the website to get complete information about the lead. This leads to unnecessary time wasted in navigating to multiple pages to extract information. So this chrome extension extracts information from the leads tab in seconds which takes a human to do it in hours. This chrome extension allows sellers to save a lot of their time while using IndiaMart website.
