# T2E-Chrome_Extension
This extension allows you to easliy take the leads from Indiamart website onto an Excel with information you want in seconds not hours.
<br />
<b>This project uses a bunch of technologies used in it which are listed over here:-</b> <br />
1.  Chrome API <br />
2.  SheatJS Library<br />
3.  Javascript <br />
4.  HTML <br />

This chrome extension is specifically made for the the website Indiamart sellers can connect with buyers. They do this connection in form of leads that sellers 
can pursue or leave. Once the leads are bought they are shown in Lead Manager tab with information regarding buyer and his/her requirements.
But there is a flaw in the website in which seller has to click multiple times to go to different parts of website to get complete information of the lead. 
This leads to unnecessary time waste in navigating to multiple pages to extract information. So this chrome extansion does this for us and extracts all the information 
of the lead in seconds where it takes a human to do it in hours. This chrome extension is very much helpful to the sellers on Indiamart by saving their time by a big factor.
